Preterm labor. This is labor that starts too soon, before 37 weeks of pregnancy.
Chronic health conditions. These are health conditions that last for a long time or that happen again and again over a long period of time. Chronic health conditions need to be treated by a health care provider. Chronic health conditions that may lead to having a baby with low birthweight include high blood pressure, diabetes and heart, lung and kidney problems.
Taking certain medicines to treat health conditions, such as high blood pressure, epilepsy and blood clots. Tell your provider about any prescription medicine you take. You may need to stop taking a medicine or switch to one that’s safer during pregnancy.
Infections. Certain infections, especially infections of the internal reproductive organs during pregnancy, can slow a baby’s growth in the womb. These include cytomegalovirus, rubella, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis and certain sexually transmitted infections.
Problems with the placenta. The placenta grows in the uterus and supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Some problems in the placenta can reduce the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the baby, which can limit the baby’s growth.
Not gaining enough weight during pregnancy. Pregnant people who don’t gain enough weight during pregnancy are more likely to have a low-birthweight baby than those who gain the right amount of weight. If you have an eating disorder or have been treated for an eating disorder, tell your provider. Your provider can check on you and your baby carefully throughout pregnancy to help prevent complications and make sure you’re both healthy.
Having a baby who was born too early or who had low birthweight in the past.
Being pregnant with multiples (twins, triplets or more). More than half of multiple birth babies have low birthweight.
Smoking, drinking alcohol, using street drugs and abusing prescription drugs. Pregnant people who smoke are more than 3 times as likely to have a baby who weighs too little at birth than people who don’t smoke. Smoking, drinking alcohol, using street drugs, and abusing prescription drugs during pregnancy can slow the baby’s growth in the womb and increase the risk for preterm birth and birth defects.
Exposure to air pollution or lead
Being a member of a group that experiences the effects of racism and health disparities.
Domestic violence. This is when your partner hurts or abuses you. It includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse.
Age. Being a teen (especially younger than 15) or being older than 35 makes you more likely than other parents to have a low-birthweight baby.""",

Labor problems. Fetal macrosomia can cause a baby to become wedged in the birth canal (shoulder dystocia), sustain birth injuries, or require the use of forceps or a vacuum device during delivery (operative vaginal delivery). Sometimes a C-section is needed.
Genital tract lacerations. During childbirth, fetal macrosomia can cause a baby to injure the birth canal — such as by tearing vaginal tissues and the muscles between the vagina and the anus (perineal muscles).
Bleeding after delivery. Fetal macrosomia increases the risk that your uterine muscles won't properly contract after you give birth (uterine atony). This can lead to potentially serious bleeding after delivery.
Uterine rupture. If you've had a prior C-section or major uterine surgery, fetal macrosomia increases the risk of uterine rupture during labor — a rare but serious complication in which the uterus tears open along the scar line from the C-section or other uterine surgery.

Helping your child feel comfortable around strangers

Don’t ignore or dismiss your child’s fear of strangers. This could make the fear worse.
Hold your child’s hand or let them sit on your lap when they meet new people.
Introduce strangers first at home, if possible. Home is where your child feels most comfortable.
If your child gets very upset with a new person, comfort them and try a different approach like all playing together. You could also move your child slightly away from the new person until they calm down. Then you can try again.
Take your child’s comfort item (toy or blanket) with you when you’re spending time with new people.
Stay calm yourself. Your child will pick up on your cues. They’ll be more likely to be calm and confident if they sense that you feel the same way.
Taking it slowly

Be patient. Don’t push your child to go to new people before they’re ready.
Try to introduce new people one at a time, rather than in groups. You can work up to introducing 2 or more people as your child develops confidence.
When you introduce your child to someone new, stay with your child. This will reassure them that you’re not going to leave them with unfamiliar people straight away.
Ask unfamiliar adults, like extended family or adult friends, to wait for a while before they pick up your child.
For slightly older children, explain to your child who the new person is and what’s happening. For example, explain that the new babysitter is someone you trust. Also say when you’ll be back.
Meeting new people

Keep introducing your child to new people. The more chances your child has to meet new people and discover that they’re safe, the more likely it is that their fear will reduce.
Show your child that you’re not scared of new people. Greet them warmly with positive body language – smiles, relaxed posture, eye contact and a happy voice.
Help older children practise some coping strategies for meeting new people – for example, ‘Let’s take some calm breaths together’ or ‘Here’s a big kiss that will last all day. Can I have one too?’ These simple strategies can help your child feel more confident around unfamiliar people.
Don’t worry about grown-ups’ feelings. Just tell them that your child is learning to be around strangers.",

Give your child plenty of new experiences and introduce them to new faces. With time, they’ll realise that nothing bad will happen. Try not to rush in to solve problems, and give your child a chance to work out solutions for themselves. Encourage your child to be responsible for some simple family chores – for example, putting things in the supermarket trolley, checking the letterbox or setting the table. Help your child learn to settle for sleep away from home.
