,There are recommended meal timings or strategies for pre-dawn meals and breaking the fast for breastfeeding mothers during Ramadan.,5 (Very Plausible),TRUE,https://health.cornell.edu/about/news/ramadan-fasting,"1. Stay hydrated. Try drinking fluid several times throughout the night, even if you aren't feeling too thirsty—thirst is a signal that your body is ALREADY dehydrated. Choose fluids that don't contain caffeine, because caffeinated drinks can be dehydrating. Remember, breaking your fast at iftar (the evening meal after sunset) with water not only is traditional, it ensures that you get the best source of hydration into your body before becoming distracted with food. But, be careful and don't go overboard with drinking too much at one time. Trying to drink a few gallons all at once can dilute your body's electrolytes, inducing a potentially fatal condition called water intoxication.

2. Variety is the spice of life. Eat a variety of foods during the evening. Now, more than ever, your body needs good nourishment to compensate for the stress of fasting. Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, lean protein, healthy fat (fat from plants, like olive oil and nuts)—all of these are important to give your body all the nutrients it needs.

3. Portion size is important. It takes the body about 20 minutes to register that it's had enough to eat. So don't go overboard with eating during iftar. Eating mindfully and listening for when your hunger is actually satisfied puts less stress on your body and gives you more energy than eating huge amounts at one time.

4. Keep moving. Though fasting can be physically exhausting, try not to be completely sedentary. If you typically work out during the morning, see how your body feels if you switch exercise to the evening after breaking your fast. Strenuous exercise is not a good idea during the day because you can quickly become dehydrated. Think small—short easy walks (to classes or doing errands) or a few stretches can go a long way in keeping your energy up during the day.

5. A few secrets to a successful sehri (pre-sunrise meal). Together, the components of a balanced meal help your blood sugar remain most stable, which gives you good energy. Some of the elements to include in your sehri:

Whole grains—sources include whole grain cereal, whole grain bread, brown rice, and oatmeal.
Fresh fruits and vegetables—check out the produce section for dozens of ideas!
Protein—sources include milk, yogurt, eggs, nuts.
Healthy fat—sources are nuts and olives.
Try these easy combinations in addition to drinking water during sehri:

Oatmeal made with low-fat milk and topped with fruit and nuts.
A bowl of whole-grain cereal and low-fat milk, topped with fruit and nuts.
A piece of whole-grain toast, a boiled egg, and a piece of fruit.
A peanut butter sandwich on whole grain bread and a glass of low-fat milk.
A banana or apple with peanut butter and a glass of low-fat milk.
A bowl of vegetable soup, a piece of whole grain toast, and a glass of low-fat milk.
Whole-wheat couscous salad with mixed vegetables, olive oil, and canned tuna.

The American Dietetic Association recommends vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy and while breastfeeding for mothers who eat vegan or vegetarian diets.

Maybe. Continued use of a prenatal vitamin postpartum may exceed the iron and folic acid needs of a breastfeeding mother. However, some people, such as those with vegetarian and vegan diets, may not get adequate nutrients through their diet alone and may be at greater risk for nutritional deficiencies.  In addition, the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) (the average amount of a vitamin or mineral that meets the daily nutrient needs of nearly all healthy people) for some nutrients (such as iodine and choline) increase while breastfeeding; therefore, it is possible that diet alone may not be sufficient to ensure adequate nutrition for women who are breastfeeding.
