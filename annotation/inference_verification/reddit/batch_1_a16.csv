Use handrails.  If you live in a two-story home or are in a place with stairs, always use the handrails and do not carry multiple items up the stairs in both arms. Always leave a free hand to hold on.
Use lighting. Turn stairwell lights on when going up and down. If you don’t have good lighting, now is the time to get some installed. It is very easy to miss a step when you cannot see going up and down stairs.
Make sure stairs are carpeted properly. Slipping and falling on stairs is common. Use good secure stair carpets or something similar to ensure proper foot traction.

Falls during early pregnancy usually don't lead to injury for the fetus.

Falls that happen during the late second trimester and third trimester could be more harmful. That's especially true if you fall onto your belly, or if you hit your belly on something as you fall. That kind of fall may cause contractions or the loss of amniotic fluid. The placenta also could separate from the inner wall of the uterus. That condition is called placental abruption.

The more you breastfeed or pump, the more milk your body makes. So, if you seem to be producing less milk than usual, nurse your baby more often. You also can pump after nursing to help stimulate more milk production.

Some things, like stress, illness, and some medicines, can temporarily lower your supply. But drinking plenty of water and eating nutritious foods can help. Also try to take some time for yourself each day, even if it's only for 15–30 minutes.
