These children typically start crawling earlier than those who start out on hands and knees because belly crawling takes less strength and balance. On occasion, babies use this method of crawling right up until the moment they walk. Others move to criss-cross crawling before walking.Criss-cross crawling or hands and knees crawling requires limbs from opposite sides to coordinate with each other. A baby alternates arms and legs, getting the arm on one side to meet the floor at the same time the opposite leg does. Give your baby as much floor time as possible. Allow your baby to discover sitting and standing completely on her own. This way she will build strength and coordination necessary for crawling on hands and knees.Minimize holding or propping your baby upright to prevent her from developing excess muscle tension that makes crawling difficult.",https://thefnc.com/research/crawling-is-important-for-childhood-brain-development/
