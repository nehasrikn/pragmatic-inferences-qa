Their rapidly expanding blood volume, developing baby, and placenta all require increased iron. The World Health Organization recommends 40-60mg per day, with women who are already anemic or have other risk factors on the higher end. Infants born to anemic mothers have up to have the iron reserves as infants born to mothers with normal levels of red blood cells. Iron supplements often contain vitamin C to help your body absorb it, and likewise eating a diet rich in vitamin C (lots of citrus fruits and fresh raw vegetables) can help you better absorb the iron you may be already eating.

In the second and third trimester, it's common to have what are known as Braxton Hicks contractions. These are practice contractions that are helping your uterus prepare for labor. If you do feel them they may feel like tightening of your uterus, or even low back pain that is coming and going. Generally, these contractions aren't regular and they also may stop or change with activity. That is one way to distinguish them from labor contractions. Labor contractions gradually get stronger, and you may not be able to talk or walk while you are having one. Contractions also become much more intense when your water breaks, as you no longer have the cushion of amniotic fluid.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/stages-of-labor/art-20046545

Another method is to leave the decision of when to wean up to the child; children who are eating three meals a day often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk supply will gradually dry up from lack of demand.",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/weaning.html
