A proper car seat, diapers, wipes, clothes, and a safe sleeping surface for baby (cot or crib) are the bare essentials, with feeding choices dictating other purchases.  If you are nursing, a breast pump and pads are important.  For formula feeding families, bottles, formula, and access to clean water are essential.

Starting at birth, you can do tummy time daily with your infant.  As they get older, you can encourage movement by having them reach for toys while in tummy time.  Once they are on hands and knees, making a safe obstacle course with pillows can encourage them to push off and go.  Always baby-proof your space and provide a safe landing for baby and let milestones come naturally.  Pushing them can slow them down. ",https://www.zerotothree.org/resource/steps-toward-crawling/

How to manage clogged milk ducts?,"{'author_id': '84ka1SZgxahTsy8lyty9TUPkJ5k1', 'timestamp': '2023-01-29 23:34:33.755630+00:00', 'id': 'qa_pairs/55q3gnt57osH3oRdf52b'}","Clogged milk ducts happen when inflammation is so great that milk cannot pass freely and the breasts cannot be drained.  The best preventative measure for clogged ducts is to feed early and often (at least every 2 to 3 hours from beginning of feed to beginning of feed in the first month) for at least 15-20 minutes per side.  If you are experiencing a tender lump or hard area on your breast, working on decreasing inflammation will allow the milk to release. Nursing or hand expressing instead of pumping with an electric pump is preferred as a pump can pull more lymph fluid into the breast, further exacerbating inflammation.  Very gentle massage, including lymphatic massage, during feeding sessions and ice for 15 minutes after each feed can help.  Heat, vibration, and deep massage are no longer recommended as they can make inflammation worse.  Anti-inflammatory medications such as advil are helpful if not medically contraindicated. Choline is the active ingredient in sunflower lecithin and it alone at a dose of 550 mg daily can help persistent clogs. Call an IBCLC if you can not remove any milk at all or are experiencing redness or warmth on the breast or a fever.

Little ones look to us as an example of how to act. While moderling good emotional health, teaching your toddler skills to handle their big emotions is key to helping them feel less stressed.  Regulating, relate and reason is a model that can help.  First help them to regulate their emotions by making sure they are safe, helping them name what emotion they are feeling, and staying calm.  Next, relate to them.  Telling them that their emotions are ok and that you understood can help to de-escalate situations.  Finally, when they are regulated and feeling safe, you can try to reason with them by walking them through what happened and what they can do next time.  If you are having a hard time regulating them, the acronym PHALT can be helpful.  Potty, hungry, angry, lonely, and tired are the precursors to meltdowns a lot of the time.

Your body will give you a few clues though.  The biggest clue that you are beginning to dilate and efface is losing your mucus plug.  Your mucous plug is formed at the opening of your cervix during pregnancy and as the cervix begins to dilate, it can come away.  Some people notice an increase in discharge, especially if it is pink or tinged with blood (also known as bloody show).  Some people lose the plug all at once, noticing a thick, gelatinous piece upon wiping. Once in heavy labor, a dark line can sometimes be seen on fair skinned people in the crevice of the buttocks when they are fully dilated.

It is not the heartburn that causes the hair to grow though, but an excessive surge of hormones.  This surge causes the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, increasing heartburn.  This same increase in hormones seems to be linked to more hair growth in the baby.  Of course this is only if it is due to hormones.
