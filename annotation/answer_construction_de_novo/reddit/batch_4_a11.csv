How do I introduce solids to my four-month-old baby?,"{'original_question': 'How to introduce solids?', 'subreddit': 'Mommit', 'post_id': 'lrf63'}","It is typically not recommended to introduce solids to a four-month-old baby. Before introducing solids to baby, make sure baby can sit up unassisted. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that for most children, you do not need to give foods in a certain order. Your child can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months old. By the time he or she is 7 or 8 months old, your child can eat a variety of foods from different food groups.  Most babies this age are ready to try solid foods. Experts recommend starting solid foods when a baby is about 6 months old, depending on the baby's readiness and nutritional needs. Does your baby swallow food or push it out of their mouth? Babies have a natural tongue-thrust reflex that pushes food back out. Wait until this reflex disappears (typically when babies are 4-6 months old). Can your baby support their own head? To eat solid food, an infant needs good head and neck control and should be able to sit up. Is your baby interested in food? Babies who stare, reach and grab, and open their mouths for food are ready to try solid foods. Be sure to check with your doctor before giving any solid food.  While there is no strict rule and each child develops at a different pace, full-term babies typically hit the mealtime milestone at 4 to 6 months of age. At 4 to 6 months old, children naturally become more aware and interested in their environment. As parents know all too well, this is also the stage when they're orally fixated to the point that they will try to put everything in their mouth. This is a signal it may be a good time to start introducing solid foods. Before making the switch to solids, a child must have good head control, and have outgrown their tongue-thrust reflex, meaning they no longer push food away with their tongue. When ready for solids, your child will open their mouth to accept food without spitting or pushing it out. But because it's a new experience, the first few times may not go smoothly -- even if your baby is ready. Keep trying if they spit out their food! Babies who are ready to try solid foods will show interest in what family members are eating. They should also be capable of moving food from a spoon to their mouth and swallow without choking. parents to ask their pediatrician questions around their baby's 4-month checkup. Your pediatrician can help you learn about how to introduce solid foods to your baby safely, as well as help you decide when to do it.

What is GBS and what does it mean to be GBS positive?,"{'original_question': 'Can someone explain GBS to me?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': 'g96wux'}","GBS stands for Group B streptococcus which is a type of bacteria that can be found in the vagina.

This bacteria can be found the vagina of many women without causing a problem. However, for some pregnant women, this can cause problems. To be safe, your doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the bacteria infection. Group B Streptococcus (group B strep, GBS) is a type of bacteria often found in the urinary tract, digestive system, and reproductive tracts. The bacteria come and go from our bodies, so most people who have it don't know that they do. GBS usually doesn't cause health problems. About 1 out of every 4 women have GBS. In pregnant women, GBS can cause infection of the urinary tract, placenta, womb, and amniotic fluid. Even if they haven't had any symptoms of infection, pregnant women can pass the infection to their babies during labor and delivery. Pregnant women are routinely tested for GBS late in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 35 and 37. The test is simple, inexpensive, and painless. Called a culture, it involves using a large cotton swab to collect samples from the vagina and rectum. These samples are tested in a lab to check for GBS. The results are usually available in 1 to 3 days. If a test finds GBS, the woman is said to be ""GBS-positive."" This means only that she has the bacteria in her body -- not that she or her baby will become sick from it. Doctors will test a pregnant woman to see if she has GBS. If she does, she will get intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor to kill the bacteria. Doctors usually use penicillin but can give other medicines if a woman is allergic to. It's best for a woman to get antibiotics for at least 4 hours before delivery. This simple step greatly helps to prevent the spread of GBS to the baby.

Is it best for pregnant women to avoid caffeine altogether?,"{'original_question': 'Is it maybe just best for pregnant women to avoid caffeine altogether?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': 'kfyg8a'}","If you're pregnant, check with your doctor about having caffeine. It's usually OK to have 1 or 2 cups of coffee, but it's best not to have more than that. Studies show that getting more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day during pregnancy may not be healthy. This is about how much is in a 12-ounce cup or two 6-ounce cups of coffee. Drinking lots of caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, and possibly other pregnancy problems. 	Having too much caffeine during pregnancy may increase the risk of complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or having a baby who is small for their gestational age. Some women find they become more sensitive to caffeine during pregnancy, reporting that even small amounts make them feel jittery and anxious. Caffeine can also affect sleep, causing pregnancy insomnia and it may make morning sickness worse. Another side effect is more frequent urination (needing to wee more often) and bladder irritation.

Can sudden movements from my baby cause shaken baby syndrome?,"{'original_question': 'Can baby move themselves hard enough to cause shaken baby?', 'subreddit': 'beyondthebump', 'post_id': 'tw2l4m'}","No, sudden movements by the baby are not strong enough to cause abusive head trauma, also known as, shake a baby syndrome alone. Head or neck injury from physical child abuse. It happens when someone shakes a baby or hits the baby against something hard. Most cases happen when a parent or caregiver is angry, tired, or upset because a baby won't stop crying or the child can't do something they expect, like toilet train. No, a newborn does not possess enough strength to cause abusive head trauma known as shaken a baby syndrome. Things like gently bouncing a baby on a knee or riding in a bumpy car won't cause the problems seen in abusive head trauma. Abusive head trauma happens when someone, uses force to shake a child, uses force to throw or drop a child on purpose, or hits the child's head or neck against an object, like the floor or furniture, or hits the child's head or neck with an object. Abusive head trauma (AHT), which includes shaken baby syndrome, is a severe form of physical child abuse. It results in injury to the brain of a child. AHT is a leading cause of physical child abuse deaths in children under 5 in the U.S. Babies less than 1 year old are at the greatest risk of injury from AHT. AHT can be prevented.  Shaking, hitting, throwing, or dropping babies and toddlers can have dangerous results. A baby's neck muscles can't support the stress of shaking. When the baby is shaken, its head moves in a sudden whiplash motion that can cause bleeding inside the head and increased pressure on the brain. Shaking, hitting, throwing, or dropping baby or child can cause irreversible brain damage, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, blindness, deafness, seizures, paralysis or death. Babies who survive severe shaking will likely need lifelong medical care. Rapid or sudden movements by the newborn/infant cannot cause shaken baby syndrome.

Some women will be able to bring in a full supply within weeks. Some will take a bit longer, and some will never quite be able to bring back a full milk supply. Every ounce of breast milk counts, though, and making peace with what you have is vital when you're working on relactating. That said, there are some factors that will determine how successful you will be at relactation including: The younger your baby is, the easier it will be to relactate. Moms with babies in the 3 to 4 month range usually have the highest success rates. The more well established your milk supply was before weaning, the easier it will be to re-establish it. The more time you have to attempt breastfeeding and pumping, the better, as frequent and effective breastfeeding and pumping is the most important physiological factor for relactation. The more interested in breastfeeding your baby is, the easier this process will be. The more educated you are about how relactation works, the more success you'll have.

How much pain is normal when milk comes in?,"{'original_question': 'How much should it hurt when milk comes in?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': 'efo1yu'}","During the first 2-5 days after birth, it's normal to have engorged (very full) breasts as your milk supply increases. But if your baby nurses (or you pump) every 2-3 hours, your breasts should not feel engorged. Although your breasts and nipples may be tender or uncomfortable, once your baby is well-latched, breastfeeding should not be painful. Sometimes pain can happen if you have an improper latch, a milk duct that is clogged with milk (plugged milk duct), a breast infection (mastitis), or other issues. If you have pain while breastfeeding, especially with a fever, talk with your doctor or nurse to figure out why. When your milk comes in, your breasts will become fuller and firmer. If your baby is feeding well and frequently, this should pass without problems. However, some women's breasts become rock hard, and they may also be tender, uncomfortable, even painful - a condition called breast engorgement. Engorged breasts may also feel fairly hot due to all the activity inside - it's like a traffic jam in there! Although it's only temporary, often lasting 24 to 48 hours, engorgement can also make it difficult for your baby to latch, as your nipples may become flattened.","https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/breastfeeding/what-to-expect.html, https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/breastfeed-discomfort.html  "

As the abdominal wall expands and contracts during pregnancy, the repaired hernia area may fail to hold the tissues together, leading to hernia recurrence. Mesh repair may not adequately cover the weakened area and result in recurrence.
Given the expansion of the abdominal wall during pregnancy, biomaterial characteristics of shrinkage and compliance should be considered. It has been previously shown that the flexibility of the abdominal wall may be restricted by large mesh implants.11 However, so far there are actually no data indicating that mesh repair of symptomatic ventral hernias should be prohibited in the reproductive woman who desires future pregnancy.

It's also possible to experience let-down sensations or leaking for months after suppressing lactation. Galactorrhea (guh-lack-toe-REE-uh) happens when your breasts unexpectedly produce milk or a milk-like discharge. This nipple discharge may leak from your breast on its own or when touched.

Should I prevent my 3 month old from napping at night?,"{'original_question': 'Should I stop newborn from napping at night?', 'subreddit': 'NewParents', 'post_id': 'fv8ap5'}","Most 3-month-old infants should be getting a total of 14 to 17 hours of sleep in 24 hoursTrusted Source. So, that means your little one should only be awake for 7 to 10 hours per 24-hour cycle. Of course, your 3-month-old isn't going to be awake for a full 8 hours at a time. During this stage, it's not unusual for little ones to wake for a few hours and then sleep for a few hours, around the clock. However, around 3 months, some babies will start to get on board with the whole days/nights thing and begin to sleep through the night for as many as 6 to 8 hours at a time -- a welcome change for sleep-deprived parents. Keep in mind that all babies are different, and each one reaches sleep milestones at their own pace.

Can doctors force interventions during labor?,"{'original_question': 'Can doctor force intervention on you during labour?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': '9eik2v'}","Historically, âinformed"" consent meant the doctor informed a patient of his plan. In modern health care, informed consent involves the bidirectional sharing of information. The clinician informs a patient of her diagnosis, its natural history, available treatments, and their risks and benefits; the patient tells the clinician about her individual values, circumstances, and preferences. Based on his professional opinion, a clinician then recommends, offers, or recommends against a particular treatment or course of action. Knowledge of the ethical basis of informed consent can improve communication between clinicians and patients, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and reduce harm when women refuse recommended care. A woman's autonomy trumps the beneficence of the doctor or State. Coercion and abandonment are ethically abhorrent and inappropriate in modern health care. Caregivers should not perform unsafe interventions; however, attendance in labor is not an intervention. Clinicians continuing to care for women who refuse advice are fulfilling their professional duty of care. Colleagues, professional organizations, hospital administrators, and the legal profession must recognize that respecting a woman's right to choose is not supporting her choice-ethical and legal liability for harm caused by her refusal is hers. Guidelines need to be written in a patient-centered manner that qualifies risk and incorporates women's choice. Remember that your doctor and midwife are there to support you throughout your labor and birth, and to make sure that you and your baby stay safe and healthy. They are trained to manage situations where the unexpected happens. In most situations where you doctor or midwife suggests an intervention, there will be time for them to explain why it is needed, and you will be able to discuss your options together. It's important to consider the risks and benefits of having an intervention to both you and your baby, as well as any risks associated with declining the intervention. You have the right to choose whether to have any intervention in your labor or birth. If you aren't sure whether you want an intervention, it's a good idea to ask your doctor or midwife for more information to help you decide. Many women also find it helpful to involve their partners or other support people when deciding. In an emergency, your doctor or midwife may decide what to do on your behalf to protect your health or your baby's health.

Sanitize all items (even the bottle brush and wash basin) by using one of the following options. Check with the item's manufacturer about which method to use. To boil: Place disassembled feeding items into a pot and cover with water. Put the pot over heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Remove items with clean tongs. To steam: Place disassembled items in microwave or plug-in steam system and follow the manufacturer's instructions for sanitizing, cooling, and drying the items. To bleach: (if you can't boil, steam, or use a dishwasher) Prepare a bleach solution of 2 teaspoons of unscented bleach per gallon (16 cups) of water in a clean wash basin. Put all items completely underwater. Make sure the solution touches all parts and there are no air bubbles in the bottles. Squeeze solution through nipple holes. Soak items in solution for at least 2 minutes. Remove with clean hands or tongs. Do not rinse because germs could get back onto the sanitized items. Any remaining bleach will break down quickly as it dries and will not hurt your baby. This process is similar to what is done to sanitize dishes in restaurants. After sanitizing, place items on a clean, unused dish towel or paper towel in an area protected from dirt and dust. Allow to air-dry thoroughly before storing. Do not use a dish towel to rub or pat items dry because doing so may transfer germs to the items. Assemble a clean pump kit. Check to make sure the pump kit or tubing has become dirty or moldy during storage. If your tubing is moldy, dispose of and replace it immediately. If you're sharing a pump, clean it. Be sure to clean the surface of the pump, including the power switch and dials. After using your breast pump each time: Store the milk safely. Cap the collection bottle or bag you're using and label with date and time it was pumped. Immediately put it in a refrigerator, freezer or coolerbag with ice packs. If the milk collection container will be stored at a hospital or child care center, be sure your name is on the label. Clean the pumping area. Especially if you're using a shared pump, clean the dials, power switch, and countertop with disinfectant wipes again. Take apart & inspect the pump kit. Take apart the breast pump tubing and separate all the parts that come in contact with the breast and/or breast milk. This includes flanges, valves, membranes, connectors and milk collection bottles. Rinse & clean the pump kit. Rinse the breast pump parts that come into contact with the breast and/or breast milk. Hold them under running water to remove any remaining milk. As soon as possible after pumping, clean the pump parts that come into contact with the breast and/or breast milk in one of the following ways.","https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Clean-Your-Breast-Pump.aspx, https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/childcare/clean-sanitize.html#:~:text=Place%20disassembled%20feeding%20items%20into,Remove%20items%20with%20clean%20tongs.

You can stop pumping every three hours when your baby is around 3 months old. As they grow, they will take more at each feeding, but go longer between feedings. If your milk supply is plentiful, you may be able to go longer between pumping sessions, as well. By the time your baby has gained back their birth weight, they may no longer need to be woken at night for a feed. You might want to keep a pumping session right before you go to bed, even if they don't eat at this time. The amount of milk your body makes depends on the number of times your breasts are emptied throughout the day. Draining the breast by pumping often, like your baby would be nursing, will build or maintain a good supply of pumped milk. Most babies breastfeed about eight to 12 times every day. Pumping should closely follow the same pattern as your baby would be breastfeeding. Pump every three hours around the clock or at least eight times in 24 hours until you build a good milk supply.

Even mothers who feel ready for weaning may feel a sense of loss. Support and encouragement are important during this time. Extra physical contact and affection with your baby helps to compensate for the loss of the closeness of nursing. Even for those who are happy to be done breastfeeding or pumping, the days after weaning can be an emotional time. Some mamas feel tearful, sad or mildly depressed after their baby is done nursing. Others may feel irritable, anxious or moody. Many feel a mix of emotions, such as relief, grief, and sadness about the loss of connection and those sweet feeding time snuggles. Though the depression can pass after your hormones return to normal, post-weaning depression can become serious. A health-care professional can help you manage your mental health so you can feel like yourself again.
