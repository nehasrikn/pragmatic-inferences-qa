Many providers will not do an elective (not for medical reason) induction before 39 weeks of gestation. Some women are advised by their doctor to have a medically indicated induction at 38 weeks. Sometimes this is because they have been diagnosed with gestational hypertension, they have poorly controlled diabetes, or because there are complications with their pregnancy.",https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/labor-induction
