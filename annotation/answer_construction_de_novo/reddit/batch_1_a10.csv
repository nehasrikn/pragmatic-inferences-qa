Is it likely for a baby to go back into a breech position while swimming?,"{'original_question': 'Is it likely that the baby goes back into a breech position while swimming?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': 'osu6sd'}","No evidence-based data exists that swimming in a swimming pool is effective to turn a baby's position inside the womb. Many healthcare providers and fitness professionals recommend swimming as one of the safest exercises for pregnant women as it keeps the body toned without adding weight and stress to the joints and raises the heart rate without the risk of tripping falling. Almost all babies are breech at some point during pregnancy, and nothing has been shown to prevent a baby from turning to a breech position. Most babies will naturally move to a head-down position by 36 weeks of pregnancy. If your baby presents in a breech position after 36 weeks, speak to your healthcare provider to discuss safe delivery options. Trying to turn a baby may not be a safe option for some high-risk pregnancies.","https://utswmed.org/medblog/breech-baby/,

When do babies no longer need formula or breastmilk?,"{'original_question': 'When do babies no longer need formula or breastmilk?', 'subreddit': 'beyondthebump', 'post_id': '8f50bp'}","The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first six months of life. After that, they recommend a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least one year old. If a baby is weaned from breastmilk before the age of 12 months, formula should be given instead in place of breastmilk until the age of one. A baby should continue with formula after one year in certain circumstances such as when the baby is not gaining weight, if the baby was born prematurely, when a balanced solid food diet has not been established, if the baby has an underlying health condition or food allergy, or based on a doctor's recommendation. Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for the first two years of a child's life. When to wean a baby is a personal decision and will be different for everyone. It can be influenced by many factors including the mother's return to work, the health of mother and baby, and simply a feeling that the time is right.","https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/breastfeeding/weaning.html, https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/weaning.html"
Can a baby develop structural abnormalities after the 20 week scan?,"{'original_question': 'Can baby develop structural abnormalities after 20 weeks?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': '3jwoc7'}","During pregnancy, the major structures of the body form in the first trimester, or before 14 weeks of gestation. These include the spine, head, arms, and legs. The organs also develop, such as the heart, stomach, lungs, brain, and central nervous system. By 20 weeks of gestation, the majority of structural development in the fetus has already occurred, and abnormalities can be detected on an ultrasound. In general, major abnormalities of the body and internal organs are more likely to develop between five to 14 weeks of gestation. Once a body part has formed, it is no longer at risk to develop major birth defects although its growth and/or function could still be affected after it has formed. Also, some organs continue to develop past the first trimester until birth, such as the lungs, the brain, central nervous system, and eyes. It is also important to note that a 20-week ultrasound doesn't find all congenital conditions that could already be present. It can help detect several serious conditions and major developmental problems. Some conditions exist that will not be known until the baby is born. For example, many heart abnormalities are not found until birth. Additionally, the scan results are not a formal diagnosis of any health condition but indicate further tests are needed.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22644-20-week-ultrasound, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582659/"
When is it safe to start co-sleeping with my baby?,"{'original_question': 'When can I start co sleeping with my baby?', 'subreddit': 'beyondthebump', 'post_id': 'iusxgw'}","Many people use the terms “bed-sharing” and “co-sleeping” to describe the same thing. Co-sleeping is when a parent and child sleep in close social or physical contact of each other. Room-sharing and bed-sharing are types of co-sleeping. Sharing an adult bed with a baby, known as bed-sharing, increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, suffocation, and other sleep-related infant deaths. The risks are especially high in infants younger than four months, preterm infants, and babies with low birth weight. Because of the risks involved, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns against bed-sharing. The AAP understands and respects that many parents choose to routinely bed share for a variety of reasons; however, on the basis of evidence, the AAP is unable to recommend bed sharing under any circumstances. Instead, the AAP recommends room-sharing with baby for at least the first six months. Room sharing means baby has his or her own sleep space such as a crib, bassinet, or portable play yard, in the parent's room but separate from the parent's bed. Room-sharing without bed sharing is protective for the first year of life. If parents prefer to move baby to another bedroom, it is best to wait until the baby is at least six months old.","https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/reduce-risk/FAQ, https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/1/e2022057990/188304/Sleep-Related-Infant-Deaths-Updated-2022?autologincheck=redirected,

To keep baby warm, dress baby in several layers of light clothing such as a cotton snap-bottom shirt and a fleece sleeper. Then button baby up in a polyester or down-filled bunting, and wrap baby in a blanket if needed. A hat should totally cover the ears and fasten under the chin so it won't fall off. Avoid clothing or boots that are too tight because poor circulation can contribute to frostbite. Placing baby in a front carrier inside your coat can help block wind and cold air, but make sure baby's mouth and nose are not obstructed. Keep in mind, if you're carrying your baby or baby is riding in a stroller, then he or she is not moving around enough to generate much body heat. Infants lose heat from their skin more quickly than do adults so keep neighborhood walks or treks to and from the car short. An infant should not be out in the cold for extended periods of time. Be particularly cautious on cold, windy days because wind makes the skin lose heat faster. Check often for signs of frostbite such as whitening of the skin, which usually appears first on extremities and areas that are most exposed to wind and cold. Check baby's face, ears, fingers, and toes frequently, even if you think baby is wearing plenty of clothing. Once indoors, remove layers promptly to avoid overheating. Also remove wet clothes immediately because moisture draws heat away from skin.","https://www.bmhvt.org/winter-safety-for-babies/#:~:text=Newborn%20babies%20need%20to%20be,wear%20in%20the%20same%20situation, https://www.themotherbabycenter.org/blog/2013/02/nine-tips-for-newborns-in-the-winter/"

Some conditions exist when mothers should not breastfeed or feed expressed breast milk for safety reasons, such as if the mother has certain viruses like HIV or Ebola, she is undergoing cancer treatment, or if she is taking certain medications or using illicit drugs. A mother also cannot breastfeed if her baby is born with certain conditions that do not enable the baby physically nurse or digest breast milk. More commonly, educational and societal barriers may prevent a woman from breastfeeding. For example, women may lack knowledge about breastfeeding and the skills needed to hold and position a baby at the breast, achieve a latch, and other techniques. The perceived inconvenience of breastfeeding, commitment required, and difficulties in establishing breastfeeding are sometimes keep a mother from breastfeeding. Women who encounter problems early on, such as pain, mastitis, and failure to establish a latch, are less likely to breastfeed. Concern about insufficient milk supply is another frequently cited reason women do not breastfeed. Having a poor milk supply can result from infrequent feeding or poor techniques, but lack of confidence in breastfeeding and not understanding normal lactation can lead to the misperception of an insufficient milk supply when the quantity is actually enough to nurture the baby.

How can I increase my let down speed during breastfeeding?,"{'original_question': 'How to increase let down mid feeding?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'x50ke6'}","Let-down occurs when breast milk releases from tiny sacs in the breast and “lets down” into the nipple, allowing a baby to breastfeed. Let-down is a reflex regulated by a chain reaction that starts with the release of the hormone oxytocin. The pituitary gland at the base of your brain releases oxytocin as a reaction to different stimuli, such as a baby sucking your nipple, when you see, hear, or think about your baby, when you touch your breasts, or when you're expressing milk. If your let-down doesn't come quickly and easily, one way to improve let-down includes relaxation. Stress can prevent your oxytocin release, so finding ways to manage stress and relax can help. Finding a comfortable spot to nurse is helpful, as well as taking deep breaths and listening to relaxing music. Use a preferred breastfeeding position that feels comfortable for you and your baby. Getting into the same position each time can cue your brain to trigger the let-down reflex. Focusing on your baby and using skin-to-skin contact can help. Before breastfeeding, pump or hand express for about a minute before breastfeeding, gently massage your breasts, or use a moist heating pad or warm wash cloth on your breasts. Pain can inhibit let-down, so if you have pain while breastfeeding, contact a healthcare provider or lactation consultant to address the cause.",https://health.clevelandclinic.org/breastfeeding-let-down

It is imperative that pregnant people planning a home birth are informed about the factors that are critical to reducing perinatal mortality rates and ensuring the safety of both mother and baby. Planned home births are not recommended for safety reasons in certain circumstances, such as fetal malpresentation, pregnancy with multiples, or prior cesarean delivery. Unplanned home birth is especially unsafe, and patients in need of critical support following an unplanned home birth often require emergency transfer to a hospital.

Is PPD a valid reason for not breastfeeding?,"{'original_question': 'Is PPD a legitimate reason for not breastfeeding?', 'subreddit': 'Mommit', 'post_id': '1i8qft'}","If a mother is experiencing postpartum depression (PPD), it is important to consider if breastfeeding brings her joy and peace or makes her depression symptoms worse. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months and up to a year if mutually desired by mother and baby. If breastfeeding is helping a mother bond with her baby and not contributing to her PPD symptoms, then PPD treatment can and should be built around protecting the breastfeeding relationship. If breastfeeding is contributing to a mom's PPD symptoms, she should not feel guilty if she chooses to seek alternative forms of feeding.",https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Postpartum-Depression-Breastfeeding.aspx
Is it possible to wean my 10 month old baby in the next 10 days before a visitation?,"{'original_question': 'Can 10 month old be weaned in a week?', 'subreddit': 'Mommit', 'post_id': 'qm0i5m'}","If you need or want to actively wean your baby before it happens naturally, it is best for you and your child to go slowly. Weaning too suddenly can be physically painful for you and emotionally hard on you and your baby. The time it takes to wean depends on several factors, including your baby's age, the number of times each day you typically breastfeed, and whether your child is ready to wean. Especially during the first year, when breastfeeding is your baby's main source of nutrition, weaning works best if you eliminate just one nursing session at a time over several days. For example, if you drop a feeding every three days, and you usually nurse about eight times a day, it could take four weeks to fully wean your baby. Weaning your child too quickly may cause your breasts to become painfully engorged. If your baby is younger than one year old, you will need to substitute your breast milk with formula. Consider delaying weaning if your baby is teething or sick because your baby will need extra comfort during these times. Antibodies in breastmilk can also help your baby fight off illness. Also, if your baby is resisting all of your attempts to wean, it may just not be the right time. If you can, wait and try again in another month or two.",https://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-home-work-and-public/weaning-your-baby
When should I start sleep training my almost two month old baby?,"{'original_question': 'When to sleep train?', 'subreddit': 'beyondthebump', 'post_id': '2ygr0c'}","Infants younger than three months rely on a caregiver to rock, hold, or nurse them to soothe back to sleep because they can't yet regulate their emotions. After a baby is about three months old, he or she can be taught to self-soothe. Babies who self-soothe can calm down with little or no help from you. The process may involve sleep training and can take some time, but it helps your baby and you in the long run. It's still important to check on your baby if he or she wakes up a start crying to make sure all basic needs are met. Self-soothing won't work for babies who are hungry, sick, or have a dirty diaper. Sleep training may require several different methods. One method that works for one baby may not work for another. It's ok to experiment or combine methods as needed to help your baby.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14300-sleep-in-your-babys-first-year
Can you diet while nursing?,"{'original_question': 'Can you diet while Nursing ?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'c86cgg'}","Pregnancy and lactation are special stages of life for women, and nutrition plays a vital role to support the health of the mother and baby. Increased calorie and nutrient intakes are necessary to support the growth and development of the baby and maintain the mother's health. Women should meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs with nutrient-dense foods as part of a healthy diet pattern. Breastfeeding mothers generally need an additional 330 to 400 kilocalories to meet their nutritional needs while breastfeeding, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The number of additional calories needed is also affected by age, body mass index (BMI), activity level, and the extent of breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding versus breastfeeding and formula feeding). Postpartum weight retention results in about one in seven women moving from a healthy weight classification before pregnancy to an overweight classification postpartum. Weight management is complex, so women should seek advice from a healthcare provider on the best way to achieve their weight management goals while breastfeeding.","https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf, https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html"
