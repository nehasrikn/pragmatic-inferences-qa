Is it safe to lay on my stomach at 28 weeks of pregnancy?,"{'original_question': 'Is there a point where laying on your stomach is unsafe?', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': '4p973a'}","While it may not be comfortable, it is fine to lay on your stomach at any point in pregnancy.

Is it okay to give my baby a bottle full of foremilk with no hindmilk?,"{'original_question': 'Is it okay to give my baby a bottle full of foremilk with no hindmilk?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'jfxg2m'}","The concept of foremilk and hindmilk has been widely debunked, with experts staying that there is no moment during a pumping or nursing session where the milk suddenly changes and becomes more fatty.  Due to it being a gradual change throughout the pumping or nursing session, as long as the milk removed is enough to make a bottle for baby, then it is fine to give baby whatever milk you have expressed.  If you are concerned with your infant receiving higher fat milk, make sure to keep them on the breast until it is drained, or express milk until the breast is drained for the other feedings.

Is it important to use the slow flow nipple in the feeding bottle at all times or should I switch to the faster flow nipple for my 4 month old?,"{'original_question': 'Should I continue to use slow flow nipples the entire time I am breastfeeding?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': '8zgkj6'}","If you are switching between breast and bottle, it's important to keep the infant on a slow nipple for as long as they are willing to take it.  Using a slow nipple ensures that the baby is using the same muscles to bottle feed that they are using to breastfeed and can help eliminate flow preference (mistakenly thought of as nipple confusion).  If you are strictly bottle feeding, positioning is more important than flow.  As long as baby is supported, sitting upright, and the bottle is being paced so baby doesn't choke, you are fine to use a slightly faster nipple.",https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Bottle-Feeding-How-Its-Done.aspx

For fevers above 102° F (39° C), they advise acetaminophen for discomfort.

How can I avoid purple pushing during hospital birth?,"{'original_question': 'How to avoid purple pushing when giving birth in hospital - is it possible at all??', 'subreddit': 'BabyBumps', 'post_id': 'zetn0n'}","The best way to avoid purple pushing if you have an epidural is to make sure that it is turned down so that you can feel pressure.  This will help you to know when to push.  Pushing too early is one of the main causes of purple pushing.  Once you reach 10 cm, if all is well, it is helpful to wait until you feel the urge to push. The pushing phase is the most stressful for the infant, so it is helpful to shorten the phase by waiting until the body is ready. Once you feel the urge to push (which might feel like you need to produce a bowel movement), push in whatever way feels natural as the urge comes. It is not necessary to sustain pushing for long periods or to hold one's breath as this can tire you out and cause distress in the baby. Once the urge to push leaves, rest and breathe deeply before the next urge comes.  If baby needs to be delivered quickly, changing positions will usually allow them to rotate and come more quickly.  Being upright or on hands and knees can help as gravity will assist the baby in coming down. ",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1804305/

The number one reason that supply is low is inadequate stimulation and draining of the breasts.  In the first 2 weeks, you need to fully drain your breasts either by nursing or pumping at least 8 times in a 24 hour period for at least 15-20 minutes.  If you are exclusively pumping, it is important to be properly fitted for a flange using a ruler and testing different sizes to ensure proper stimulation.  After the first 2 weeks, if you are still experiencing low supply even though you are nursing or pumping frequently, it can be helpful to seek advice from an IBCLC.  Some common causes for low supply outside of inadequate stimulation include: retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage, hormonal imbalances (including postpartum thyroiditis), poor diet and herbs that can be counterproductive for some people (including common galactagogues which are herbal supplements to increase supply).

How can you tell if you have postpartum depression (PPD)?,"{'original_question': 'How do you know if you have ppd?', 'subreddit': 'beyondthebump', 'post_id': 'ouyswv'}","Mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping are common after having a baby.  Starting within the first 2 or 3 days, these feelings can last for up to two weeks and are commonly known as ""baby blues."" When it lasts longer than this or consists of more severe symptoms, it is known as postpartum depression.  Symptoms might include: crying often, difficulty bonding with baby, withdrawing from friends and family, changes in appetite, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.

Is milk supply always supply and demand based?,"{'original_question': 'Is milk supply always supply and demand based?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'txxkgz'}","There are many factors that can influence milk volume, but adequate stimulation or demand, is necessary to keep milk supply steady.  Each time the baby or a pump stimulates the breasts and extracts the milk, it signals to the brain that supply needs to stay high.  If demand decreases, then supply will decrease over time.  Hormonal, anatomical and other medical issues with the lactating parent can influence the overall volume of milk, but adequate demand is necessary for the body to produce as much milk as it can.

As they get older, they tend to consolidate their feeds to every 3-4 hours with a longer stretch at night, taking in between 3-5 ounces per feed.

When can I start building a stash of pumped breast milk?,"{'original_question': 'When can I get a pumped “stash”?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'lddx2m'}","It is best in the first month to allow baby to dictate how much milk they need by nursing frequently (every two to three hours) and fully.  Once supply has been established, around 6 weeks, and baby is gaining well, you can start pumping regularly to build a stash of milk.  Pumping before then to build a stash is not recommended as it can cause your body to overproduce, which can be painful for you and make the flow difficult to handle for your baby. It is generally advised to pump once or twice a day for 15-20 minutes after baby feeds. More milk will be extracted overnight or early in the morning.

Will eating broccoli and Brussel sprouts make my baby gassy?,"{'original_question': 'Can I eat fiber?', 'subreddit': 'breastfeeding', 'post_id': 'rs9l1e'}","Though these myths have been prevalent for years, there is no solid evidence that eating certain foods will cause gas in breastfed infants outside of an allergy.  The most common allergies are dairy, soy, eggs, fish, peanuts, shellfish, sesame and wheat.  Broccoli and brussels sprouts cause gas when eaten because a certain sugar that is in them stays in your gut and becomes fermented, causing gas.  Since this sugar (raffinose) does not pass through breastmilk, it is physiologically impossible for these foods to cause gas in an infant that is not ingesting them directly.
