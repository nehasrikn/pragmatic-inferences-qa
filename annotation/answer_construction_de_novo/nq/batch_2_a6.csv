where is the baby situated in early pregnancy,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"In weeks 4 to 5 of early pregnancy, the embryo grows and develops within the lining of your womb. The placenta develops shortly after conception and attaches to the inner wall of your uterus. In these early weeks of pregnancy, the embryo is attached to a tiny yolk sac that provides nourishment. A few weeks later, the placenta will be fully formed and take over the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Your baby is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord. The placenta starts as a few cells and grows to be several inches long.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22337-placenta, https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/1-to-12/4-weeks/#:~:text=In%20weeks%204%20to%205,then%20later%20into%203%20layers."

when does the amniotic sac attached to the uterus,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"In week 4, one week after fertilization, the tiny bundle of cells turns into a blastocyst and implants into your uterine lining. The beginning of what will become the placenta forms. A water-tight sac forms around the blastocyst. This is the amniotic sac, and it provides cushioning to a fetus during pregnancy.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/7247-fetal-development-stages-of-growth
where does implantation and formation of the placenta normally occur,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine wall — a process called implantation.  The placenta develops shortly after conception and attaches to the wall of your uterus.

which of the following are methods that could identify a genetic disorder in a fetus,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"With amniocentesis, the doctor inserts a thin needle through the pregnant woman's abdominal wall into the uterus. A small sample of amniotic fluid is taken from the sac surrounding the fetus. When the fluid is analyzed in the laboratory, it can check for serious genetic and chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome​. With chorionic villus sampling (CVS), a long, slender needle is inserted through the abdomen to remove a small sample of cells (called chorionic villi) from the placenta. Or a catheter (a thin plastic tube) is placed into the vagina and then inserted through the cervix to take cells from the placenta. This sample is then analyzed in the laboratory. During pregnancy, some of the baby's genetic information (DNA) crosses into the mother's bloodstream. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) analyzes this DNA to check if the baby has a higher chance of having certain chromosomal disorders. A blood sample is taken from the mother (not from the baby) usually after the tenth week of pregnancy.

when does beta hcg become positive in urine,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"For many tests, HCG can be detected in your urine about 10 days after conception.

when fertilization and implantation occur what prevents the regression of the corpus luteum,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"If the egg gets fertilized, your uterus will send chemical signals to your corpus luteum and it will release progesterone for about 12 weeks.

when can a baby be delivered and survive,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"In general, infants that are born very early are not considered to be viable until after 24 weeks gestation. This means that if you give birth to an infant before they are 24 weeks old, their chance of surviving is usually less than 50 percent Some infants are born before 24 weeks gestation and do survive. But these infants have a very high chance of severe long-term health problems. About 40 percent of these preemies will suffer long-term health complications because they were born prematurely. The survival rate for 24-week-old infants is between 60 and 70 percent.  But, a 24-week old preemie's chance of dying goes down dramatically if a woman can stay pregnant for just two or three weeks longer. The preemie's chances of having long-term health problems also decrease dramatically.

why can't a baby come out feet first,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"The position of the baby's head matters for delivery. During birth, the baby's head pushes through the vaginal canal, widening it and making it possible for the rest of the body to follow more easily. If the baby's buttocks or feet lead the way, labor can become more difficult and dangerous. Dangers of a vaginal breech birth include cord prolapse (a rare emergency when the umbilical cord exits the cervical opening first), traumatic injury such as a dislocated shoulder, or reduced oxygen if the head cannot pass through the canal after the rest of the body quickly enough. To avoid these risks, your OBGYN may recommend turning the baby to the head down position with an external, manual manipulation called external cephalic version (ECV). If that doesn't work or your baby remains in the breech position at week 39 gestation, your OBGYN will recommend a C-section as the safest birth option","https://madisonwomenshealth.com/blog/breech-baby-what-causes-it-and-what-to-expect/#:~:text=The%20position%20of%20the%20baby's,become%20more%20difficult%20and%20dangerous."

how do they remove the umbilical cord from the mother,{'source': 'reddit unanswerable'},"The third stage of labour is when your placenta and the bag that held your baby and the amniotic fluid (the membranes) are delivered. In most hospital units, the third stage is ‘actively managed' because it is known that women who opt to have this are at less risk of significant blood loss at delivery. However, you may choose a physiological, ‘unaided' third stage.During an actively managed third stage: you'll have an injection to reduce the size of your womb, your midwife will clamp and cut the umbilical cord, and you'll deliver the placenta with or without the help of your midwife. At this stage, you may be able to push the placenta out. But it's more likely your midwife will help deliver it by putting a hand on your tummy to protect your womb and keeping the cord pulled tight.
