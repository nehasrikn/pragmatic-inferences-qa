when does a baby become viable outside the womb,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"In later pregnancy, a health care professional may use the term “viable” to indicate the chance for survival that a fetus has if delivered before it can fully develop in the uterus. During the periviable period, which is weeks 20 through 25 of pregnancy, rates of neonatal survival to discharge at this time range dramatically from 23%-27% for births at 23 weeks, 42% to 59% for births at 24 weeks, and 67% to 76% for births at 25 weeks of gestations. Deliveries before 23 weeks have only a 5-6% survival rate, and of those rare survivors, almost all have significant disease or medical conditions. Fetal viability depends on many complex factors, of which gestational age is only one. Other factors that influence viability are sex, genetics, weight, circumstances around delivery, and availability of a neonatal intensive care professional. Even with all available factors considered, it still isn't possible to definitively predict a fetus's survival. While some babies delivered during the periviable period can survive outside the womb, they may also experience significant disease and impairment. Some fetal conditions exist for which survivability will be poor regardless of when the pregnancy ends. No definite diagnosis of viability exists, and no test can definitely determine whether a fetus could survive outside of the womb. Determining whether a pregnancy is viable beyond the first trimester is often based on clinical judgment. While health care professionals cannot predict with certainty the outcome for an individual pregnancy or fetus, they can help patients understand their individual risks and circumstances so that they can make informed decisions for their pregnancy and their individual health.",https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/understanding-and-navigating-viability
what is normal weight of baby during birth,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"A healthy weight for a baby at birth can vary. Most babies born at term (between 37 and 40 weeks) weigh between 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) and 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams). Newborns who are lighter or heavier than average are usually healthy but may get extra attention from doctors and nurses after delivery to make sure no problems exist. One factor that can affect a baby's size at birth is the length of pregnancy. Babies born near their due date or later tend to be larger than those born earlier. Most babies born with low birth weight are born prematurely, or before 37 weeks of gestation. Other factors that can affect birth weight are the size of the parents, if the baby is part of a multiple birth, birth order, gender, mom's health during pregnancy, nutrition during pregnancy, and baby's health.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24980-low-birth-weight, https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/grownewborn.html#:~:text=Newborns%20come%20in%20a%20range,13%20ounces%20(4%2C000%20grams)"
what stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. If the egg gets fertilized, and an embryo implants in the uterus, then a placenta will also begin to develop. The placenta is the organ that holds the developing fetus and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone that makes the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus. The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for about 12 weeks, at which point the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus, and the corpus luteum then regresses and breaks down.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21849-corpus-luteum, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532950/#:~:text=Human%20chorionic%20gonadotropin%20is%20a,the%20liver%2C%20and%20the%20colon"
when does the fetus begin to develop memory,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"The ability to remember people and things dramatically increases in babies aged 8 to 12 months, but this is short-term memory. Long-term memory is different. Researchers have found that children have great difficulty recalling the past before 12 months of age because the brain is too immature to firmly register experiences. The brains of older babies have developed enough to record and retrieve memories of single distinctive experiences, such as playing a game they played months before. Most single experiences before the age of 8 months, unless very emotional or painful, are probably not remembered. Even though memory is not fully developed in infancy, experiences in early childhood are important in building and acquiring the development of memory. Memory is a complex cognitive ability that is important in many aspects of thinking and learning, including language, reading, following directions, problem solving, and imagining. For memories to become part of the child's life story and be real to them, there must first be a developed sense of self and personal identity. Children do not fully develop a sense of self until typically around 1 ½ or 2 years of age. Having a sense of self gives a place for the memory to be organized and develop personal meaning.","https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/11/long-term-memory-kicks-in-after-age-one/, https://extension.psu.edu/programs/betterkidcare/early-care/tip-pages/all/developing-memory"
how does the placenta detaches from the uterus after birth,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"When a baby is delivered vaginally, the placenta is also delivered vaginally after the baby is born, usually within 30 minutes. The uterus will naturally continue to contract to expel the placenta, and it might require one more push to deliver the placenta. Sometimes complications may arise during delivery of the placenta. A retained placenta might occur if contractions are not robust enough to completely expel the placenta or if all or part of the placenta remains attached to the uterine wall. The placenta may also become trapped behind a partially closed cervix. To assist in the delivery of the placenta, your health care provider might administer a drug to continue uterine contractions and reduce bleeding. Massaging your lower abdomen can also encourage the uterus to contract and expel the placenta. Breastfeeding can also make the uterus contract and may be enough to expel the placenta. If delivery of the placenta takes longer than 30 minutes, heavy bleeding often results. Emergency surgery may be required as a last resort to remove a retained placenta and reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Surgery is also necessary in rare, severe cases such as placenta accreta, when the placenta has grown deeply embedded in the womb.","https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/placenta/art-20044425, https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/labor-and-birth/retained-placenta"
when does the anterior fontanelle close in babies,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Fontanelles are the soft spaces on a baby's head where the skull bones have not yet fused together. The anterior fontanelle is located near the front, top of a baby's head and usually closes between 7 and 18 months, while the posterior fontanelle, at the back of the head, usually closes within the first two months after birth. The fontanelle spaces allow for the skull bones to shift as needed during birth and for a baby's brain to grow. It is OK to lightly touch your baby's fontanelles; they should feel soft and flat. Premature babies or babies with ongoing medical conditions might have fontanelles that close on a different schedule. Talk to your baby's healthcare provider to understand when to expect your baby's fontanelles to close. If you feel your baby's fontanelles are closing too soon or haven't closed by 18 months, consult your pediatrician. Also, talk to your healthcare provider if you see a bulging or sunken fontanelle, which may be a sign of a health issue.","https://www.childrenscolorado.org/conditions-and-advice/parenting/parenting-articles/fontanelles/#:~:text=Typically%2C%20fontanelles%20close%20by%20the,18%20months%2C%20consult%20your%20pediatrician"
when do babies stop being afraid of strangers,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Anxiety around strangers is usually one of the first emotional milestones your baby will reach. During the ages of 8 to 9 months, babies might become anxious, clinging, easily frightened, and cry around unfamiliar people or objects. These behavior patterns occur because your baby is now able to tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar situations. The predictable anxieties during this stage of development are evidence of a healthy relationship with your baby. Stranger anxiety usually abates by the age of two years. Both the duration and the intensity of stranger anxiety vary greatly among children. Some infants and young children show a strong preference for one parent over another, or grandparents or caregivers may suddenly be viewed as strangers. Comforting the child and avoiding overreaction to the behavior are usually the only therapy needed to help the child during these situations. Stranger anxiety that lasts beyond the age of two or is very intense may be a sign of a more generalized anxiety that should be evaluated by a health care professional.","https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-8-12-Months.aspx, https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/symptoms-in-infants-and-children/separation-anxiety-and-stranger-anxiety"
when does relaxin start being produced during pregnancy,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Relaxin is a reproductive hormone that loosens and relaxes the muscles, joints, and ligaments during pregnancy to help the body stretch and accommodate a growing fetus and prevent early contractions by relaxing the uterine muscles. It also helps to prepare the body for delivery by loosening muscles and ligaments in the pelvis. Relaxin is produced by the ovaries even before pregnancy. Levels are low until ovulation, when it starts to rise to prepare the uterus for implantation. If conception occurs, relaxin levels stay high and continue to rise through the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta also begins to produce relaxin during pregnancy. Relaxin levels in the body peak around 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Then, levels decline for the remainder of pregnancy before surging just before delivery of the baby in order to relax the pelvic muscles and widen the cervix.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24305-relaxin
when does a baby's lungs start functioning,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"During pregnancy, the lungs begin to develop during the first eight weeks of life and continue developing throughout the duration of a pregnancy. The rate of lung development can vary greatly, and the lungs are among the last organs to fully develop. Around week 25, the lungs are fully formed but not yet ready to function outside the uterus. Inside the mother's womb, the lungs are filled with fluid, and oxygen is supplied through the umbilical cord. By 37 weeks, the lungs are functional and ready to undergo their biggest change at birth, when they must quickly start breathing air to supply the baby with oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. The lungs of babies born before 37 weeks are usually not fully developed, which puts premature infants at risk for developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Researchers have been able to make artificial surfactant as an effective treatment for babies with RDS.","https://www.lung.org/blog/how-young-lungs-develop#:~:text=Throughout%20the%20pregnancy%2C%20these%20%22branches,develop%20%E2%80%93%20usually%20around%2037%20weeks, https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/how-your-fetus-grows-during-pregnancy, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151"
what is a collapsed follicle in an ovary,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"A collapsed follicle occurs with normal ovulation, when one of the ovaries releases an egg from a follicle. The follicle physically collapses and becomes cloudy when viewed on ultrasound imaging. This collapsed follicle undergoes structural and functional transformation to become the corpus luteum, which releases the hormone progesterone to support pregnancy. In some cases, a follicular cyst may develop when a mature follicle collapses on itself.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34724259/#:~:text=Ovulation%20(follicular%20collapse)%20was%20defined,collapsed%20follicle%20or%20corpus%20luteum, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066197, https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/ovary-pain-understanding-ovarian-cysts"
when does a baby's vision fully develop,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"A baby's vision develops at his or her own rate, but the overall pattern of development is the same. Because a baby's vision develops quickly during the first year of life, a baby's pediatrician will check the eyes at each well-child visit. Once a baby is born, a baby's vision goes through many changes. Newborn infants generally have poor eyesight and little ability to focus beyond 6 or 10 inches away. Their eyes are very sensitive to bright light. Their central vision is still developing. Within a couple of weeks, they can start to see light and dark ranges and patterns and start to focus on objects right in front of them. The amount of color vision is not known for certain, but infants probably do not see subtle differences in color until two to three months of age. A baby's eyesight will improve as he or she grows and remains awake for longer periods of time. Around four to five months of age, a baby's eyes work together to develop depth perception, and a baby can see in three dimensions more completely. They also have improved color vision. By 12 months, a baby's vision reaches normal adult levels while he or she continues to explore and learn about the world. Even after the first year, regular eye exams with a health care provider are important to identify problems that may arise later in childhood.","https://www.healthychildren.org/english/ages-stages/baby/pages/your-baby%27s-vision-1-month.aspx, https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/healtharticle.your-developing-baby-week-26, https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/baby-vision-development-first-year"
what causes a rupture in the amniotic sac,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"During pregnancy, your baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled membranous sac called the amniotic sac. The fluid inside the amniotic sac is called the amniotic fluid. When the membranes of the amniotic sac rupture, amniotic fluid comes out of the vagina. This is known as your “water breaking” and is a sign that the baby will be delivered soon. In most cases, the membranes rupture during labor or within 24 hours before the start of labor. Your healthcare provider may even break your water for you, called an amniotomy. It is not clear what happens in a pregnant person's body to cause the amniotic sac to rupture. Experts think it may be caused by signals in the fetus's brain or from hormones that weaken the amniotic sac. If you are not already in labor and experiencing contractions, no other signs that your water is going to break exist.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24382-water-breaking
when do the clinical manifestations of an ectopic pregnancy typically appear,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus. Most often, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in a fallopian tube, which usually carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in other areas such as the ovary, abdominal cavity, or cervix. The fertilized egg can't survive in areas other than the uterus, and an ectopic pregnancy cannot proceed normally. Healthcare professions typically diagnose ectopic pregnancies in the first trimester, within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most people discover they have an ectopic pregnancy around week 8 of pregnancy. No symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy may be apparent at first; some women have the usual early signs of pregnancy, such as a missed period and nausea. An early warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy is light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Pain in the lower abdomen and lower back is also common. Some people feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement, depending on where blood collects and which nerves are irritated. The fallopian tube may rupture and cause heavy bleeding inside the abdomen. Symptoms include extreme lightheadedness, low blood pressure, fainting, shock, and sudden, sharp lower abdominal pain. Without emergency treatment, a ruptured tube can be life-threatening.","https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20372088, https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9687-ectopic-pregnancy"
what effect does an increase in luteinising hormone have on the endometrium,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Luteinizing hormone (LH) spurs ovulation and helps with the production of the hormones progesterone and estrogen that are needed to support pregnancy in the uterus. In the brain, the pituitary gland releases LH during the ovulatory and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. An initial surge in LH during the ovulatory phase causes the release of an egg from the ovary, or ovulation. Then the during luteal phase, LH is released at a constant pace for two weeks, which stimulates the production of progesterone and estrogen hormones in the ovaries. Progesterone and estrogen prepare the uterus in case an embryo is implanted by causing the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, to thicken and fill with fluids and nutrients to nourish a potential embryo.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22255-luteinizing-hormone, https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/biology-of-the-female-reproductive-system/menstrual-cycle"

where does edema tend to occur in the pregnant woman's body,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Swelling during pregnancy is normal because the body produces approximately 50% more blood and body fluids to meet the needs of the developing baby. This condition is called edema. Fluid may accumulate in tissues, usually in the feet, ankles, and lower legs, causing them to swell and appear puffy. Some fluid accumulation during pregnancy is normal, particularly around the fifth month and during the third trimester. Occasionally the fingers also have mild swelling, but severe swelling in the hands and feet as well as swelling in the face may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious health condition that can cause organ damage in the mother and health complications in the unborn baby. Other conditions that cause swelling are deep vein thrombosis and peripartum cardiomyopathy. If you have severe or sudden edema, especially swelling in the hands and face, seek medical attention immediately. Other warning signs include persistent headache, changes in vision, confusion, severe upper abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and high blood pressure.","https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-health-wellness/swelling-during-pregnancy, https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/symptoms-during-pregnancy/swelling-during-late-pregnancy"
when does a baby lose their startle reflex,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"The Moro reflex is a type of involuntary response to stimulation that is one of the many normal reflexes present at birth. It is often called the startle reflex because it usually occurs when a baby is startled by a loud sound or movement. In response, the baby throws back his or her head, extends out his or her arms and legs, cries, and then pulls the arms and legs back in. Your baby's pediatrician will check for this reflex right after birth. It normally lasts until the baby is about two to four months old.

when is the first us done in pregnancy,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"A prenatal ultrasound (or sonogram) is a test done in pregnancy to check on the health and development of your baby. Ultrasounds can help to determine how far along you are in pregnancy and to make sure your baby is growing properly. Other times, your pregnancy care provider might order an ultrasound to determine if there are any potential problems or medical conditions present in the pregnancy. Ultrasounds may occur at any time in pregnancy depending on what your health care provider needs to look for. Most pregnant people have one or two ultrasounds during pregnancy, one in the first trimester and one in the second trimester. The number and timing vary depending on your pregnancy care provider and if you have any health conditions. Some people have an early ultrasound as early as seven or eight weeks of pregnancy to confirm pregnancy, check for multiple fetuses, measure the size of the fetus, and help confirm gestational age and due date. The anatomy ultrasound is usually performed around 18 to 20 weeks in pregnancy.

when do the first signs of tooth development begin,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Babies are born with a full set of teeth below their gums. A wide range of variability exists of when a first tooth may appear, but they usually start coming in between the ages of 6 and 12 months. A first tooth usually breaks through the gum line when a baby is six months old. Typically, the first teeth to come in are the lower front teeth. Teething can cause pain and discomfort in babies; they may show signs of discomfort in the area where the tooth is coming in, and the gums around the erupting tooth may be red, swollen, and tender. The baby may drool more than usual. Other signs include fussiness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, and biting or chewing on objects. Babies might also have a slight fever. The best way to soothe a teething baby is by gently rubbing the sore gums with a clean finger or moist, cool washcloth. Offer baby a clean, rubber teether to chew on. Avoid frozen teething rings as they are too hard for baby's mouth as well as numbing gels.

does babies hair fall out with cradle cap,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"Cradle cap is a common condition in newborn babies. It causes thick white or yellow crusty scales on the scalp but can also affect the ears, eyelids, nose, and groin. The scaly patches may be dry and flaky or waxy and greasy, and they usually are not itchy. It usually does not cause hair loss. Cradle cap typically clears up on its own by six to 12 months of age. Home care measures include washing baby's scalp every other day with mild shampoo to help loosen and remove scales. Soften the skin of the scalp with baby oil. A baby brush or baby comb can also be used during baby's bath to help remove the scale in the hair. Never scratch or pick at cradle cap as this could cause an infection.

what are the causes of post term pregnancy,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"A pregnancy that lasts more than 42 weeks is called post-term. Healthcare providers do not know why some women carry a pregnancy longer than others, but it is often due to miscalculating the due date. Women are more likely to have a post-term pregnancy if they are pregnant with their first baby, had past previous post-term pregnancies, are overweight, or are having a boy. A number of possible complications exist for post-term pregnancies, such as longer labor, vaginal tearing, cesarean delivery, stillbirth and newborn death, placenta problems, decreased amniotic fluid, birth injury, and low blood sugar in the baby. To try to prevent any health problems for mother and baby during post-term pregnancies, healthcare providers may do maternal and fetal testing such as fetal movement counting, non-stress testing, and ultrasound. Heath care providers may induce labor to deliver the baby if tests find that it is not healthy for the developing baby to stay in the uterus.",https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=post-term-pregnancy-90-P02487
when do baby start to open their eyes,{'source': 'rosie answerable'},"The fetus's eyelids fuse during week 10 of gestation and remain closed until about 26 weeks of gestation. At this stage, a baby's optic nerves and retina are formed, and the eyes start to open in the womb. A baby can see inside the uterus, and the eyes continue to develop through the end of pregnancy. A few minutes after birth, most infants open their eyes and start to look around. Newborns can see, but their eyes can't focus well at first. When holding your newborn, you can encourage eye opening by taking advantage of your baby's tendency to open its eyes when held in an upright position.

when does the amniotic sac attached to the uterus,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"The amniotic sac is not attached to the uterus, but rather it is the placenta that attaches to the uterus. In very early pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants into the wall of the uterus about six days after fertilization. The fertilized egg becomes a ball of cells called a blastocyst. The inner cells of the blastocyst develop into the embryo, and the outer cells burrow into the wall of the uterus and develop into the placenta. Some of the cells from the placenta develop into layers around the developing embryo. The outer layer of membranes forms the chorion, and the inner layer of cells forms the amnion, which becomes the amniotic sac. When the amniotic sac is completely formed around days 10-12, it fills with clear a liquid called amniotic fluid and expands to envelop the developing embryo. The embryo floats within the amniotic sac and continues to grow and develop under the lining of the uterus on one side.

what is dilation of the cervical os prior to uterine contractions called,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"The cervix is a muscular, tunnel-like organ that is in the lower part of the uterus connecting the uterus and vagina. During childbirth, it widens to allow a baby to leave the uterus so the baby can travel through the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has an internal os and the external os. The internal os is the opening that leads to the uterus, and the external os is the opening that leads to the vagina. Near the end of pregnancy and in the beginning of labor, the cervix becomes softer and thinner, called effacement, and it widens, which is dilation. Dilation and effacement are caused by uterine contractions. The timing of cervical dilation is different for every woman. As you approach your due date, your cervix may start to dilate without any contractions. You may also lose the thick mucus plug that protects the cervix during pregnancy and have what is called a “bloody show.” When this occurs, it is an indication that the cervix is beginning to dilate prior to experiencing contractions.

what is the adequate amount of amniotic fluid,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"Amniotic fluid is a clear, slightly yellow liquid that surrounds the unborn baby during pregnancy, contained in the amniotic sac. The baby floats in the amniotic fluid, and the fluid constantly circulates as the baby practices swallowing and breathing the fluid and urinates it out. The amniotic fluid contains nutrients, hormones, antibodies, and other fluids to keep the baby healthy and protected. Amniotic fluid helps with fetal growth and development, keeps the baby a constant temperature, prevents the umbilical cord from compression, and cushions the baby from injury. Health care providers measure amniotic fluid using ultrasound. The normal amount of fluid depends on how far along the pregnancy is. Levels increase throughout pregnancy and are the greatest at about 34 weeks of pregnancy when it averages 800 milliliters (mL). At full term, the amount of amniotic fluid averages about 600 mL. Too much amniotic fluid is called polyhydramnios and can occur with pregnancies of multiples, abnormalities of the baby, or gestational diabetes. Too little amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios and can occur with late pregnancies, ruptured membranes, placental dysfunction, or fetal abnormalities. Health care providers may need to monitor pregnancies with abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid more carefully.","https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002220.htm#:~:text=Information&text=While%20in%20the%20womb%2C%20the,term%20(40%20weeks%20gestation), https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23310-amniotic-fluid"

Most people who have it don't know that they do, and it usually doesn't cause health problems. Pregnant women can pass the infection to their babies during labor and delivery. Some babies can become very sick from group B strep infection. Pregnant women are routinely tested for group B strep late in pregnancy, usually between weeks 35 and 37. The test involves swabbing the vagina and rectum with a large cotton swab and culturing the samples in a laboratory. Treating women with group B strep with IV antibiotics during labor can prevent babies from developing early-onset group B strep disease.","https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/groupb.html#:~:text=How%20Is%20Group%20B%20Strep,from%20the%20vagina%20and%20rectum"
when do the organs develop in a fetus,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"During pregnancy, the major structures of the body form in the first trimester, or before 14 weeks of gestation. The heart and major blood vessels begin to develop by about day 16 after egg fertilization. Most organs begin to form about five weeks of pregnancy, when the brain and spinal cord develop. Almost all organs are completely formed by about 12 weeks of pregnancy, which is the near the end of the first trimester. The exceptions are the brain and spinal cord, lungs, and heart, which continue to form and develop throughout pregnancy.

which drug when used alone is responsible for the most severe withdrawal symptoms in the newborn,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs he or she is exposed to in the womb. NAS occurs when a pregnant person takes drugs (legal or illegal) during pregnancy. At birth, the baby's dependence on the substance continues, causing symptoms of withdrawal and serious health problems for the baby. Most symptoms of NAS occur within three days after birth and can last anywhere from one week to six months. Symptoms may include body shakes, seizures, twitching, tight muscles, fussiness and excessive high-pitched crying, poor feeding and slow weight gain, breathing problems, fever, sweating, blotchy skin, trouble sleeping, diarrhea, vomiting, and stuffy nose or sneezing. The symptoms of NAS depend on the drug the mother used during pregnancy, how much of the drug used, how long the mother took the drug, how the mother's body breaks down the drug, and the baby's gestational age at birth. Some drugs are more likely to cause NAS than others, and specific drugs have been linked to specific problems in a baby. Opioids, such as heroin and methadone, cause serious withdrawal in about half of babies exposed prenatally, and symptoms can last as long as four to six months. A neonatal abstinence scoring system may be used to help diagnose and grade the severity of the withdrawal, which may help in planning treatment for the baby.

when fertilization and implantation occur what prevents the regression of the corpus luteum,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. It produces the hormone progesterone that makes the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus. If the egg gets fertilized, and implantation of an embryo occurs in the uterus, then a placenta will begin to develop. The placenta is the organ that holds the developing fetus and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone to maintain the pregnancy. The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for about 12 weeks, at which point the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus, and the corpus luteum gets smaller and starts to break down. If the egg does not get fertilized, the corpus luteum will start to break down and regress around 10 days after the egg leaves the follicle. Then the uterus will shed its lining during a menstrual period, and a new menstrual cycle begins.","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21849-corpus-luteum, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532950/#:~:text=Human%20chorionic%20gonadotropin%20is%20a,the%20liver%2C%20and%20the%20colon"
when is low birth weight most commonly diagnosed,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"Birth weight is a baby's weight right after he or she is born. Within a few hours after birth, a healthcare provider will weigh the baby and compare the baby's birth weight with the gestational age (how far along the mother was in pregnancy). A baby is diagnosed as low birth weight when he or she weighs less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) at birth or very low birth weight when he or she weighs less than 3 pounds, 5 ounces (1,500 grams) at birth. Low birth weight is common in the United States, affecting about one in every 12 babies (about 8.52% of all live births). Before a baby is born, a healthcare provider can estimate the size of your baby in different ways during prenatal exams to check if your baby might be born with low birth weight. One way to track fetal growth is by monitoring the mother's weight gain and measuring fundal height, which is the distance from the top of the mother's uterus to her pubic bone.

Approximately 70-80% of all new mothers experience some symptoms of the “baby blues.” Symptoms include mood swings, weepiness or crying for no apparent reason, impatience, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, sadness, mood changes, and poor concentration. Often symptoms are noticeable within four to five days after birth. The cause is thought to be related to hormone changes that occur after a baby is born, producing chemical changes in the brain that result in depression. Also, the large adjustment that comes after the birth of a baby, along with sleep disturbance, disruption of routine, and emotions from childbirth can all contribute to how a new mom feels.",https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/first-year-of-life/baby-blues

Infants who are breastfeeding may develop the condition with insufficient feeding, and it may occur more often in infants with very low birth weight. Symptoms include significant weight loss, lethargy, and seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring blood serum sodium concentrations that are greater than 150mEq/L (150mmol/L). Neonatal hypernatremia is potentially lethal and associated with a number of serious health conditions in babies, including brain swelling, brain bleeding, kidney failure, and infection, and can lead to death if not treated. Treatment involves cautious hydration over two to three days with an IV saline solution to decrease blood sodium levels. Monitoring mother and baby in the first weeks of life for successful establishment of breastfeeding is essential to preventing hypernatremia.

what causes sudden infant death syndrome also called sids,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death of a baby. The baby is usually less than one year old and seems to be healthy. The death often occurs during sleep. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep. Research has also found that babies who died from SIDS had high levels of serotonin in their blood, which could suggest a problem with how the body uses serotonin. Research has found some factors that put babies at higher risk of SIDS. Physical factors include defects in the area of the brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep, low birth weight, and respiratory infections that lead to breathing problems. Sleep factors include sleeping on the stomach or side, sleeping on a soft surface, sharing a bed with parents or siblings, and overheating while sleeping. While there is no definite way to prevent SIDS, you can help your baby sleep more safely. Have baby sleep in your room with you, in a crib or bassinet, for at least the first six months. Use a firm, flat mattress, and keep the crib as bare as possible. Put baby to sleep on his or her back. Keep your baby warm with a sleep sack instead of blankets and avoid overheating. Offer a pacifier for baby to suck on at nap time or bedtime.

when is rh immune globulin given during pregnancy,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"The Rh factor is a protein that can be found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive, and if your blood cells do not have this protein, you are Rh negative. During pregnancy, problems can occur if the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive. This condition is called Rh incompatibility. The mother's body will make anti-Rh antibodies, which can cross the placenta and attack the fetus's blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as severe anemia and even death, for a fetus or a newborn. Treatment can be given to prevent these problems in the form of Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg). It is a medication often given at 28 weeks of pregnancy that stops the body from making Rh antibodies if it has not already made them. RhIg can also be given within 72 hours after the delivery of an Rh-positive baby. A dose of RhIg may also be given in situations where maternal and fetal blood can mix during pregnancy, such as after amniocentesis or fetal surgery, if you had bleeding during pregnancy, if you had trauma to the abdomen during pregnancy, or if attempts were made to manually turn a fetus from a breech presentation.

where did the name cesarean section come from,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"It is not known for certain where or when the term cesarean was derived. Early history of the word cesarean has been distorted over time. It is commonly believed to be derived from the surgical birth of Julius Caesar; however, this seems unlikely since his mother is said to have lived to hear of her son's invasion of Britain. At that time a cesarean section was performed only when the mother was dead or dying as an attempt to save the child. Roman law under Caesar decreed all women must be cut open to birth a child. Other possible Latin origins include the verb “caedare,” meaning to cut, and the term “caesones” that was applied to infants born by postmortem operations. It was not until the nineteenth century that the possibility of preserving the mother's life during the procedure came within grasp of the medical profession.","https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cesarean/part1.html#:~:text=Roman%20law%20under%20Caesar%20decreed,infants%20born%20by%20postmortem%20operations"

By monitoring your baby's heart rate, your healthcare provider can tell if the heart rate is too high or too low or changing too much. The heartbeat is difficult to detect in the first trimester because the baby is so small. While a fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as 8 weeks when using a transvaginal Doppler ultrasound, an acoustic Doppler is not as sensitive. It is also not recommended to use fetal acoustic Doppler ultrasound during the first trimester due to safety risks to the fetus.

how long does crack stay in a fetus system,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"When a pregnant woman uses cocaine, it can be very harmful to her and her unborn baby. Fetal exposure to cocaine is associated with several severe risks, including premature birth, health issues, developmental delays and disabilities, and cognitive and intellectual problems. Some effects of drug use during pregnancy can persist for long after the baby is born. The extent of the negative consequences depends on dosage, timing, and duration of a mother's drug use, which influence how long the baby was exposed to the drug. A method for detecting cocaine exposure involves testing a newborn's meconium, or the first stool. Meconium formation in the fetal intestines begins around the 12th week of pregnancy and continues to build up until birth. As a result, meconium testing can detect if a fetus was exposed to cocaine as early as the second trimester. The quantity and frequency of a mother's cocaine usage during pregnancy have the biggest impact on how long it stays detectable in meconium.","https://americanaddictioncenters.org/cocaine-treatment/dangers-pregnancy, https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(01)41583-6/fulltext, https://fn.bmj.com/content/88/2/F98, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083048/#:~:text=Meconium%20is%20formed%20by%20the,after%20birth%20by%20the%20infant"

Sleep training leads to more sleep for parents and caregivers and also improves an infant's sleep quality. It is recommended that sleep training begin when baby is about four months old when babies are old enough to learn to self soothe and no longer require night feedings. One of the most famously known techniques is the cry it out method, but many other methods exist. Techniques often overlap, and methods can be combined to find out what works best for the parent and the baby.

when does the amniotic sac develop and when does it break,{'source': 'rosie unanswerable'},"During pregnancy, your baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled membranous sac called the amniotic sac. The amniotic sac is completely formed very early in pregnancy, around 10-12 days after fertilization. It fills with clear a liquid called amniotic fluid and expands to envelop the developing embryo. The embryo floats within the amniotic sac and continues to grow and develop under the lining of the uterus. When the membranes of the amniotic sac rupture, amniotic fluid comes out of the vagina, and this is known as your “water breaking.” It is a sign that the baby will be delivered soon. In most cases, the membranes rupture during labor or within 24 hours before the start of labor. Your water might break right before delivery, or your health care provider may even break your water for you. Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) occurs when the membranes break before the 37th week of pregnancy.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby's life with continued breastfeeding for up to two years of age or older. Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women stop producing breast milk when they choose to wean their baby or when their child naturally weans as he or she grows older and relies less on breast milk. Weaning usually occurs with the introduction of solid foods and cow's milk after the age of one.
