It is not necessary to sustain pushing for long periods or to hold one's breath as this can tire you out and cause distress in the baby.

If your hCG levels fall below the normal range, your doctor may want you to have a blood test every two to three days to ensure the levels are increasing.

Wear a mask when in close contact with the infant, such as when feeding at the breast or feeding from a bottle, and when expressing breast milk. Clean and sanitize breast pumps and all infant feeding items. If a mother is too sick to breastfeed her infant, another healthy caregiver can bottle feed the infant her expressed breast milk.

This bacteria can be found the vagina of many women without causing a problem. However, for some pregnant women, this can cause problems. To be safe, your doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the bacteria infection. Group B Streptococcus (group B strep, GBS) is a type of bacteria often found in the urinary tract, digestive system, and reproductive tracts. The bacteria come and go from our bodies, so most people who have it don't know that they do. GBS usually doesn't cause health problems. About 1 out of every 4 women have GBS. In pregnant women, GBS can cause infection of the urinary tract, placenta, womb, and amniotic fluid. Even if they haven't had any symptoms of infection, pregnant women can pass the infection to their babies during labor and delivery. Pregnant women are routinely tested for GBS late in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 35 and 37. The test is simple, inexpensive, and painless. Called a culture, it involves using a large cotton swab to collect samples from the vagina and rectum. These samples are tested in a lab to check for GBS. The results are usually available in 1 to 3 days. If a test finds GBS, the woman is said to be ""GBS-positive."" This means only that she has the bacteria in her body -- not that she or her baby will become sick from it. Doctors will test a pregnant woman to see if she has GBS. If she does, she will get intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor to kill the bacteria. Doctors usually use penicillin but can give other medicines if a woman is allergic to. It’s best for a woman to get antibiotics for at least 4 hours before delivery.
